I am currently a principal researcher at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/index.html), working on machine learning and natural language processing. Before joining Tencent in March 2018, I worked in the Deep Learning Technology Center (DLTC) at Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA. I completed my PhD in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in June 2014, where I worked in Adaptive Systems Laboratory (ASL), supervised by Prof. Ali H. Sayed. Before that, I obtained my Master’s degree and Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University in 2009 and Harbin Institute of Technology in 2005, respectively.
